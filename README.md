#Game Notes
This game is part of a computer model I am building to train the a computer to learn to predict moves. Only I can't get the script to move the game to the next round. UGH. I have round 1 operating perfectly and below is how the function of the game should work:

1. Round 1 Launch
2. Round 1 displays in the leaderboard
3. on launch 10 seconds to make a selection
4. at 5 seconds the "computer is making a choice" dissapears
5. on icon selection the player prompt dissapears and the corresponding icon is highlighted
6. at O seconds, the timer hides
7. at 0 seconds an image that says VS pops up and the hands start to animate to the selection made
8. when the animation stops, the computer and player hands animate to their respective selection
9. the leaderboard will say "rock beats scissors" or the correlating hands with the selection made and who beat who
10. the leaderboard will say "ROUND WINNER: (then who won the round)"
    10a. The console log will log the round, computer hand, player hand, and the winner

NEEDS HELP HERE -->
    
11. The hands and icon should reset to the default status state and unselected
12. Round 2 Launch
13. Round 2 displays in the leaderboard
14. repeat of steps 3-10
15. the game ends at 10 rounds.
